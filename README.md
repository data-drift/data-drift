# ❓ Why Datadrift?
We know providing actionnable and trusted metrics is hard. Here is how Datadrift helps:

__Metric changelog and metadata__: give data consumers the full context and explain why metrics changed over time.

__Drift detection and troobleshooting__: solve metric quality issues fast and painlessly.

__Open-source__: break free from vendor-lock in and shape your own metric store with open-source collaboration.
